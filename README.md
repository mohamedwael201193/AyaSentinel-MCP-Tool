# AyaSentinel: Real-Time Crypto Transaction Analysis Engine

A high-performance, production-ready MCP server for real-time risk analysis.

**Live API Endpoint ‚Üí [https://aya-sentinel-mcp.onrender.com/tools](https://aya-sentinel-mcp.onrender.com/tools)**

</div>

AyaSentinel is a critical security layer for the Web3 ecosystem. In an environment where financial losses from scams and fraud are a major concern, our engine provides instant, actionable intelligence. By analyzing transaction metadata, address reputation, and smart contract interactions, AyaSentinel generates a risk score before a user commits to a potentially irreversible action.

By leveraging machine learning, decentralized logging, and a scalable architecture, AyaSentinel provides a robust solution for integrating advanced security intelligence into wallets, DApps, and other Web3 services.

## üèõÔ∏è Technical Architecture

AyaSentinel is built on a modern, scalable stack chosen for performance, reliability, and decentralization.

- **Application Framework:** Flask serves as a lightweight and robust Python web server.
- **AI/ML Integration:** The system follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its capabilities as standardized "tools".
- **GPU-Accelerated Compute:** Comput3.ai provides the GPU resources necessary for deep transaction analysis without compromising speed.
- **Decentralized Ledger:** Hedera HCS is integrated for immutable logging of all risk assessments.
- **Deployment & Hosting:** The application is deployed on Render with continuous integration from the main branch.

## üöÄ API Endpoints & Usage

The API is live and can be tested directly.

### GET /tools

Retrieves a list of all available analysis tools and their required input schemas.

```bash
curl https://aya-sentinel-mcp.onrender.com/tools
```

### POST /invoke

Executes a specific tool to perform an analysis.

#### Example: Analyzing a Known Scam Address

```bash
curl -X POST https://aya-sentinel-mcp.onrender.com/invoke \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "tool": "analyze_transaction_risk",
         "arguments": {
           "chain": "ethereum",
           "to_address": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead",
           "value": 1000
         }
       }'
```
